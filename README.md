## install

```bash
npm install joke-cli -g
```

## usage

if you want to use the default function, you can use the following command:

```bash
joke create <projectName>
```

⚠️ NOTE: if you are interested in the internal operating principle, maybe you can use `npm link`:

1. `git clone ...`
2. `npm link`

then, back to your project and use `npm link joke-cli` to link it to your project.
